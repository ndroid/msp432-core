/*
 * Energia Robot Library for Texas Instruments' Robot System Learning Kit (RSLK)
 * Simplified Bump Switch Example
 *
 * Summary:
 * This example has the TI Robotic System Learning Kit (TI RSLK) activate 
 * on board LEDs using bump switches.
 *
 * How to run:
 *  Press any bump switch and observe LED states to determine correct detection:
 *      Outer right switch          Front right LED
 *      Middle right switch         Right LEDs
 *      Inner right switch          Back right LED
 *      Inner left switch           Back left LED
 *      Middle left switch          Left LEDs
 *      Outer left switch           Front left LED
 *
