/*
 * Energia Robot Library for Texas Instruments' Robot System Learning Kit (RSLK)
 * Simplified Encoder Example
 *
 * Summary:
 * This example has the TI Robotic System Learning Kit (TI RSLK) driving forward
 * by a predefined distance utilizing wheel encoders.
 *
 * How to run:
 * 1) Push left button on Launchpad to start the demo
 * 2) Robot will drive forward by a predefined distance
 * 3) Once distance has been reached the robot will stop
 * 4) Push left button again to start demo again
 *
